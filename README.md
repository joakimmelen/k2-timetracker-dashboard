## General info
This app will not blow your mind. But it blew mine creating it. From stress.
 If you have any requests for updates and/or functions to implement, please email to 
 bill-the-gaterader@microchill.cn

## Technologies
Project is created with:

#### React & React Router  
By obvious reasons.

#### Axios  
Which I picked because some (that will remain unnamed) people in my class yelled (bascially) at me to get Axios and stop using vanilla fetch.
Here we are..  
"axios": "^1.1.3" https://github.com/axios/axios

#### JSON Server  
It said in the description that we were going to use it for our backend/database. So I did.   
"json-server": "^0.17.0" https://github.com/typicode/json-server

#### uuid  
I just love unique id's


## Styling
The whole application is styled with .. hmm I have not decided yet.

## Setup 
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../k2-timetracker-dashboard
$ npm install
$ json-server --watch db.json
$ npm run dev
```
